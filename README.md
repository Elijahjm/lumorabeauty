# LUMORA Beauty — E-commerce Frontend Project

## 🌸 About the Project
**LUMORA Beauty** is a high-end skincare e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless, elegant, and interactive shopping experience. This project serves as my **final task for the Codveda Internship** in the Frontend Development role.

The goal was to build a responsive, multi-page website that balances minimalist aesthetics with modern web functionality, specifically catering to the skincare and beauty industry.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modern UI/UX:** A "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with a soft pink and white color palette.
- **Dynamic Product Rendering:** Products are managed through a JavaScript-based data system for easy updates.
- **WhatsApp Integration:** All "Buy Now" buttons and contact forms redirect automatically to WhatsApp with pre-filled, formatted messages for instant customer support.
- **Advanced Form Validation:** Custom real-time validation for contact forms to ensure user data integrity.
- **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views using Bootstrap 5.
- **Modular Architecture:** Utilizes a reusable footer component loaded via the Fetch API for maintainability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** - [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) (Layout and Grid)
